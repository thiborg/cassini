**Cassini** is an open source, portable and redistributable web server. This light-weight Microsoft's source available web server is used to be shipped with Visual Studio as integrated development server. Cassini was revived in version 4.0 with:

  * support for multiple sites
  * configuration driven
  * easy deploy
  * logging
  * portability
  * manageable design patterns
  * cool new UI
  * harnessing full C# 4.0 capabilities including new Task Parallel Library

This is going to stay free forever with a Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL) license. There are many usage of this tiny 160KB only web server which makes it enterprise-ready, coming up very soon. Stay tuned.
